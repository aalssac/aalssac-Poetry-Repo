##This is my first markdown text.


## My hope for my poem would be to write something pertaining to the strength of women. I want to focus on famous women throughout history and their accomplishments. I would want my poem to educate those that are not as familar with these women as I am. I want it to introduce them to the masses, and let the masses know why their names should be known.
